# Saalik's Advent of Code 2022

This is the repository for my solutions of Advent of Code, 2022 (my first one!)

This year, I'm writing my solutions in
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), using [Deno](https://deno.land)
as a runtime. ðŸ¦•

To get answers, run the typescript file for each day like so:

```
> deno run day1/day1.ts
```

To test:

```
> deno test --allow-read
```
